# Here_to_Inspire_discord_bot
This is the very first discord bot i have created. I have created this bot while learning from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPTfmiYiuok&t=280s.

Bot commands documentation:  
1. $hello: it says hello {username#code}!  
2. $inspire: shows a random inspiration code  
3. $responding true: sets it to monitor each text and it it finds words sad, depressing, unhappy, miserable, angry then posts a motivating line  
4. $responding false: offs the above feature  
5. $add "motivational line": gets added to the list of motivating lines  
6  $delete [index]: deletes the motivational line at index position  
7. $list: shows the full list of motivational lines  

Motivational lines can be viewed, added, deleted by anyone from any server and they are stored in the databse and can be printed sometimes when the responding is set to true  

This is a very basic bot.
